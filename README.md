# Overview

{The point of the game is to evade the AI who will chase you on sight, if they catch up they will hurt you. Survive as long as you can}

{I created this simple game to help me to understand the basics of Unreal Engine and how to create functional games with it.}

# Development Environment

{To create this project I was using the latest version of Unreal Engine (5.4)}

{This was created using a block programming method, unlike languages like python, the coding was done by creating a map of blocks of code and connecting it together.}

# Useful Websites

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* I want to improve the animations so that there is an animation when the AI attack instead of a red wire ball
* I want to make the map bigger and implement smarter AI that would patrol by zones
* I would like to create a way for the player to stun the AI to make a quick getaway.
